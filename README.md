# 1. Basic intro-to-python reference for Computing & Astronomy 

This reference contains the ```Learn Python with Jupyter``` notebooks created by ```Serena Bonaretti```.  These notebooks are published at her [Learn Python with Jupyter website](https://learnpythonwithjupyter.com). You can also download her fantastic and free book of the same title from [this location](https://www.learnpythonwithjupyter.com/assets/book/learn_python_with_jupyter.pdf). I intend to use portions of her notebooks as reference for my students in the Bush School Computing & Astronomy classes. My thanks to Serena for these excellent materials.
